title: About Me
draft: false

My name is Kamil and I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Quad. I'm in love with computers and computer science since I was a kid. I have a degree in computer science, graduating at Military University of Technology in Warsaw (engineer degree) and University of Technology in Wroclaw (master degree). I started a career as a software developer, first as backend .NET developer, quickly transforming into fullstack.

I'm also a happy husband and a father of two kids, who I love very much. While trying to find good balance between work and familly life, I try to make the best of two worlds. I enjoy writing code and solving problems, and I love playing with my kids. On this blog I'll try to share any tips and good advices I'll find useful on those two topics, and perhaps throw in something else.

I already run two blogs, [kamster.pl](https://kamster.pl "kamster.pl") and [tatainformatyk](https://tatainformatyk.kamster.pl/ "tatainformatyk") but those are in polish, which, let's face it, is not a very popular language. On this blog you can say I'll try to find audience from abroad. Another reason for existence of this site is to test my skills at writing code - this blog was written by me using Next.js - a framework based on React, written in TypeScript, with TinaCMS as the backend.

I welcome you to my blog. I hope you enjoy reading my stories. I also invite you to visit my [Github](https://github.com/kamster94 "Github").
